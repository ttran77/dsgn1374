				<h1>Response - Ted Nelson in Herzog's "Lo and Behold"</h1>
				<p>If only those people knew how foolish they would be for trying to deem Ted as insane. Ted laid down the groundwork for a whole new world of technology. I could only imagine the times in 1963, and how unadvanced the world was. Today it is so easy for people to gather any information they need from the internet. With the right resources, you could learn any practice or exercise you desire simply through the internet and hypertext. If I were to give my opinion on the future of technology, I would focus on the topic of virtual reality. Virtual Reality or VR is a new way for users to experience games and video. Fully immersing themselves in the environment for complete interaction. I have used the oculus quest 2 and can vouch for its promising future. It won’t be long until a VR universe is created and before we know it humans are living out the movie Player One in real life. But for the sake of information, virtual reality gives a new interaction experience for learning. Instead of looking at a piece of paper of the screen you are inside the simulated environment physically interacting with the subject you’re learning about. Technology still has much evolving to do. Who would’ve thought that we would’ve went from the Altair 8800 to an oculus quest 2. </p>
