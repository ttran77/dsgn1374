				<h1> Response - My Website Is A Shifting House Next to A River of Knowledge</h1>
				<p>There is so much still to learn about web design and the world of html, and CSS. Being at a beginnerâ€™s level in web design is currently very basic but interesting. Keeping just close enough to the technical side so I understand/learn, but not too much so that it is overwhelming. The number of tweaks and tricks that go into coding a website is stunning. Seeing that side of the process has given me a new sense of appreciation for the work put in. Now When I visit websites, I look for technical aspects rather then just colour and pictures. When reading this article, I found it interesting how the sites focus more on the advertising rather then the users experience. To me, it seems like whenever humans creates something new and exciting, money will always play a part and people will naturally change their motives based around money. Reading that part of the article was so eye opening because there are so many social media sites being infected with ads. It gets to point where it is so overwhelming that you actually develop a bit of anxiety. It gets even worse because most sites you visit will track your browsing history and put-up advertisements that they know you are interested in. Making it almost impossible for you to avoid. Which makes you loose focus and makes your brain think about other things. This must be corrected for our future generations to avoid complete consumption of ads. The whole start of this website evolution was based around being user friendly, providing simple and convenient tools for users. Will the ad-pocalypse ever end? Or will it takeover the internet for good? Has it already? </p>
