		<h2>What sparked your interest in Graphic Design?</h2>
		<p> From an early age i've always enjoyed drawing and linework. I would watch youtube videos of people doing speed arts and thats where my interest began. Once i graduated highschool i knew i wanted to make something i could call mine, and hopefully one day make profit from it.
		</p>


		<h2>What are your strengths/weaknesses?</h2>
		<p> At this point in my 2nd year of graphic design. i would say my strenghts are doodling and my creative thinking process. My weaknesses are photoshop and my interest to pickup a camera.</p>


		<h2>Where do you get inspiration from when designing?</h2>
		<p> When working on big projects the first thing i must do is do my research; Creating word lists, visual mind maps, mood boards, and visual brain dumping are all the steps i take when looking for inspiration. Once i have all of my research done i can review all of the content and comeup with an idea for the design.  </p>



		<h2>How do you stay organzied as a graphic designer?</h2>
		<p> Organization is the only way to stay ahead of the game as a graphic designer. Persoanlly i keep a notebook at my workstation just for notes and organization. Everyday ill write a list of things that need to be done. Throughout the day ill work through the list to make sure im meeting all due dates. Kepping updates in your phone calander is another helful way to keep you on track.</p>




		<h2>Which Adobe softwares do you gravitate towards?</h2>
		<p> Adobe Illustrator is a software that i find myself using most of the time. This software is where my artistic abilities really get to show. </p>



		<h2>How do you deal with feedback?</h2>
		<p> When receiving feedback weather it be good or bad is always crucial to the outcome of your project. Your main objective as a graphic designer is to meet the needs and demands of your customers. Making neccessaruy changes to satisfy your customer will keep them around for future projects.  </p>




		<h2>What do you intent to recieve from this course?</h2>
		<p> Once this 3 year course is completed. I would like to have a clear understanding on all of the neccessary softwares in order to be successful in any aspect of graphic design. Also i would like to have a proffessional sense in communicating with customers in order to build relationships.</p>
